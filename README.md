There is 0 point in keeping this private... Have fun with it lmao. Also I didn't make the dashboard.. All credits to their respectful owners.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Node.js by doing `node -v`.
2. Make sure MongoDB is running by doing `mongo`
3. Copy all the stuff inside of [Example.env](/Example.env) into a new file called `.env` and set all the values to their respected values.
4. Run `npm i` and make sure NPM installs all the packages.
5. Run `node .` to start the application, then check http://localhost:3000/, that is where it will start up to. You can do whatever you want from there.

## License
I'm using `GNU General Public License v3.0`... It means you have to, state the changes you made, make it open-source, and finally also use the same license.
